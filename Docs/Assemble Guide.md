# Assemble Guide  
Components needed:  
For the display and driver board, please refer to HadesVR. https://github.com/HadesVR/HadesVR  
Print all files in the STLs folder. Choose the correct lens cup model for the lenses you plan to use.  
I recommend using the lenses from the GearVR headset(2017/black version).  
If the filament you have is not black, you need black paint to paint the interior of the headset black.  
Gather the following screws: 15 * M3x6, 6 * M3x8, 4 * M3x10,  3 * M2x6, 1 * 1/4''x10mm(Vive tracker)  
Additionally, you need a thin HTC Vive face pad, some velcro hooks(with adhesives), some velcro strap and double side tape.  
Steps:  
1. Pry the lenses off from the GearVR headset.
